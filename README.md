I am a postdoc at [Debora Marks' group](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. My current research focuses in computational biology and statistics, but as a theoretical physicist I used to work primarily in early universe cosmology. 

In computational biology, I develop probabilistic models of protein and genomic sequences. In particular I am interested in the problem of making robust predictions about the map from protein sequence to protein function, and the genetic architectute driving antibiotic resistance and bacterial epidemiology.

In cosmology my work focused in inflation. 
 Making robust predictions from string theory models
 Computing observables 



Prior to Harvard, I worked at the theory group at DESY in Hamburg and the Astronomy Center at Sussex University, where I also did my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Liddle. You can see my CV
