I am a postdoc at [Debora Marks' group](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. My current research focuses on computational biology and statistics, but as a theoretical physicist I used to work primarily on early universe cosmology. 

In biology, I develop probabilistic models of protein and genomic sequences. In particular I am interested in the problem of robust predictions of the map from protein sequence to protein function, and the genetic architectute driving antibiotic resistance and bacterial epidemiology.

In cosmology my work focused in the very early universe. 
 Making robust predictions from string theory models
 Computing observables
