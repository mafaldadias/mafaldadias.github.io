I am a postdoc at [Debora Marks' group](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. My current research focuses in computational biology and statistics, but as a theoretical physicist I worked primarily in early universe cosmology. In computational biology, I develop probabilistic models of protein and genomic sequences. In particular I am interested in:
* The genetic architectute driving antibiotic resistance and bacterial epidemiology
* Robust 

In cosmology my work focused on:
* Making robust predictions from string theory models
* Computing observables 



Prior to Harvard, I worked at the theory group at DESY in Hamburg and the Astronomy Center at Sussex University, where I also did my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Liddle. You can see my CV
