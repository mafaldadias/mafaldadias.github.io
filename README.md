I am a postdoc at [Debora Marks' group](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) in the Systems Biology Department at Harvard Medical School. My current research focuses on computational biology and statistics, but as a theoretical physicist I used to work primarily on early universe cosmology. 

In biology, I develop probabilistic models of protein and genomic sequences. In particular I am interested in the problem of robust predictions of the map linking protein sequence to function, and the genetic architectute driving antibiotic resistance and bacterial epidemiology.

In cosmology my work focused on the very early universe and its relation to string theory, and can be divided in two main classes. On one hand, developing frameworks for computing accurate predictions of cosmological observables from fundamental physics models. And furthermore, building inflation models from string theory where theoretical uncertainties are explicitly taken into account within a probabilistic approach.
